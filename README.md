### Exception Handling
1. Define an custom exception (i.e. user defined exception) class called "MyFirstException". This class contains a parameterized
constructor which accept one argument String message. Whenever this exception arise will print "Custom Exception Occurred".
Create another class called MyMain. This class contains main method, to perform sum of two user given values by using Scanner class.
If the sum is less than 150 throw user defined exception or else display sum.

        input
            a = 30;
            b = 40;
            sum = a + b;
            as sum is 70 .. then

            output
            Custom Exception Occurred

2. Write a program to demonstrate exception handling for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, using command line arguments.
3. Write a program to accept numbers from user and handle all the possible unchecked exception that can occur.
4. Write a program to print a given string character by character and handle StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.
5. Write a program to handle ClassCastException, by doing explicit casting of Object to Integer.
6. Write a question which will accept a key-value pair, this function will check, if that pair is present in Hashmap, if present return that entry else throw an user defined NoEntryFound Hashmap, this exception will print a message no record found for a given pair
        Hashmap contains object of Employee class, and the key Empid for employee
        Employee class contains some fields int empid, String name, double salary, string emailid

### String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
1. Write a program to concatenate StringBuilder & StringBuffer objects.
2. Write a program to get a substring of a StringBuffer.
3. Write a program to display the length and capacity of String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
4. Write a program to check whether two given strings contains same set of characters as well as having same length.

        input
        String s1 = "amar";
        String s2= "rama";

        output : Both contains same characters

5. Write a program to lexicographically arrange the given strings "Raman" , "Aman" , "Vikram" , "Shyam" and "Bhuvan".

### Wrapper Classes (Integer, Byte, Short, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean)
1. Create objects of all the wrapper classes and print then on console, with using constructor.
2. Write a program to demonstrate boxing and un-boxing.
3. Write a program to demonstrate autoboxing and unboxing.
4. Create an array of 5 integers and print sum and average by creating Integer sum(Integer[] arr) and
Double average(Integer sum, Integer numberOfElements). Do casting as required for getting proper result;
5. Write a program to print ASCII values of Character objects using wrapper class.
6. Write a program to print the smaller of the two given Integer, Double and Character Objects.

2. Create two threads t1 & t2, t1 will print all the even numbers from 0 to 100 and t2 will print all the odd numbers from 100 to 0.
    Both threads will goto sleep for 1 sec after printing one number.

### Generics
1. Create a generic Student class to demonstrate use of generic. Student class contains a field called name, this field will show generic behavior.
It can be of Type String or Name, where name is a class representing name by two fields String firstName and String LastName.

3. Create a List of 10 Book objects, where Book is a user defined or custom class. Book class contains following field String bookName,
String author, long isbn, & double price. Book class must be properly encapsulated and must implement data hiding. Book class contains parameterized constructors
and no-argument constructor. Book class must override String toString() of Object class to represent Book object as string while printing.
Kindly sort the list of book by price.
