### Exception Handling
1. Define an custom exception (i.e. user defined exception) class called "MyFirstException". This class contains a parameterized
constructor which accept one argument String message. Whenever this exception arise will print "Custom Exception Occurred".
Create another class called MyMain. This class contains main method, to perform sum of two user given values by using Scanner class.
If the sum is less than 150 throw user defined exception or else display sum.

        input
            a = 30;
            b = 40;
            sum = a + b;
            as sum is 70 .. then

            output
            Custom Exception Occurred

### String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
1. Write a program to concatenate StringBuilder & StringBuffer objects.
2. Write a program to get a substring of a StringBuffer.
3. Write a program to display the length and capacity of String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
4. Write a program to check whether two given strings contains same set of characters as well as having same length.

        input
        String s1 = "amar";
        String s2= "rama";

        output : Both contains same characters

5. Write a program to lexicographically arrange the given strings "Raman" , "Aman" , "Vikram" , "Shyam" and "Bhuvan".

### Wrapper Classes (Integer, Byte, Short, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean)
1. Create objects of all the wrapper classes and print then on console, with using constructor.
2. Write a program to demonstrate boxing and un-boxing.
3. Write a program to demonstrate autoboxing and unboxing.
4. Create an array of 5 integers and print sum and average by creating Integer sum(Integer[] arr) and
Double average(Integer sum, Integer numberOfElements). Do casting as required for getting proper result;
5. Write a program to print ASCII values of Character objects using wrapper class.
6. Write a program to print the smaller of the two given Integer, Double and Character Objects.

### Generics
1. Create a generic Student class to demonstrate use of generic. Student class contains a field called name, this field will show generic behavior.
It can be of Type String or Name, where name is a class representing name by two fields String firstName and String LastName.
